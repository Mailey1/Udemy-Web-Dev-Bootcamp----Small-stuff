# Udemy-Web-Dev-Bootcamp----Small-stuff

#### All projects in this repository were made as part of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy, found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/

### Bootstrap

The [Bootstrap](https://github.com/Mailey1/Udemy-Web-Dev-Bootcamp----Small-stuff/tree/master/Bootstrap) folder contains a few webpages, all of which are entirely non-function, they were made purely for Bootstrap practice. [Landing Page](https://github.com/Mailey1/Udemy-Web-Dev-Bootcamp----Small-stuff/tree/master/Bootstrap/Landing%20Page) and [Image Gallery](https://github.com/Mailey1/Udemy-Web-Dev-Bootcamp----Small-stuff/tree/master/Bootstrap/Image%20Gallery) were made with Bootstrap3, and [Museum of Candy](https://github.com/Mailey1/Udemy-Web-Dev-Bootcamp----Small-stuff/tree/master/Bootstrap/Museum_Of_Candy) was made using Bootstrap4.

### To-Do List

[To-Do List](https://github.com/Mailey1/Udemy-Web-Dev-Bootcamp----Small-stuff/tree/master/Todo_List) contains exactly that, a todo list. It was made mostly for practice with jQuery (as well as a little bit of CSS). Includes the ability to add new todos, delete and crossout todos. As well as a useless little button that toggles the line to add a new todo.

## Actually interesting projects

### Colour Game

The [Colour Game](https://github.com/Mailey1/Udemy-Web-Dev-Bootcamp----Small-stuff/tree/master/Colour-Game) is a little game that displays six random colours, then gives you an rgb code in rgb(x, y, z) format which corresponds to one of the colours, then you have to guess it! Made without using any CSS or JS libraries. Done using native JS DOM manipulation instead of using jQuery.

### Patatap Clone

[Patatap](https://github.com/Mailey1/Udemy-Web-Dev-Bootcamp----Small-stuff/tree/master/Patatap) is a simplified clone of the patatap website: http://www.patatap.com/. The reading of keystrokes as well as the animated circles were made using Paperjs (http://paperjs.org/), and the use of sounds was handled by howlerjs (https://howlerjs.com/).
